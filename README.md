# React App with Vite

This is a basic React application bootstrapped with Vite.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (Latest LTS version recommended)
- **npm** (Comes bundled with Node.js)

### Installing Node.js

Download and install Node.js from the official website:

[Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

You can verify the installation by running:

```sh
node -v  # Check Node.js version
npm -v   # Check npm version
```

## Installation

Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:

```sh
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-project-folder>
```

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

## Running the Development Server

To start the local development server, run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite server, and you can access your app at:

``` sh
http://localhost:5173/
```

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, run:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will generate a `dist/` folder with optimized assets.
